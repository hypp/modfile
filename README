About
This is a Rust crate for reading and writing Amiga ProTracker MOD-files.
I wrote this as an experiment trying to learn Rust.

Please feel free to report bugs and contribute in anyway you like.

Usage
See the examples dir, but basically it is:

...
extern crate modfile;
use modfile::ptmf;
...
let mut reader = BufReader::new(&file);
let mut module = ptmf::read_mod(&mut reader);
...
let mut writer = BufWriter::new(&new_file);
ptmf::write_mod(&mut writer, &mut module);
...

And put this in your Cargo.toml:
...
[dependencies.modfile]
git = "https://github.com/hypp/modfile"
...
